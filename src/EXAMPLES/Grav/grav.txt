No idea how this one works - all I know is that there's a linedef
that controls gravity. It's type #301. Likely its exact direction handles
the exact gravity level. 

Demo WAD: Just jump when standing on the tech-tile area. Or, run towards 
it and jump. As long as you're moving upward when you enter the sector,
you'll see it in action.

Another trick that this WAD doesn't demonstrate (and I didn't test - 
can't either, as Deth is having an adverse reaction to my new video
card) is that adding 1024* to a linedef's flag value makes it keep 
the same light level despite floor/ceiling light changes.

*Just like adding 256 makes the line show up on the map from the 
start.
