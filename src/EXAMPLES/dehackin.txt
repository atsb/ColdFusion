BEX & DEH fun: 

Here's a quick rundown of some of the stuff you can find in Fusion 
that's outside of the "standard" DEH trickery. The simplest way to 
access it is to use DeHackEd on a "stanard" section of the code
then hand-renumber it later to get it where DeHackEd can't put it. 
Because DeHackEd shorthands things a bit - doesn't include the
items that match the standard Doom EXE - you might want to heavily
test things out bit by bit. I made a 90K BEX file for a TC by a 
mix of DEH renumbering (I have a QBasic program to do the 
brainwork for me:) and a fair bit of hand-hacking. 

If anyone really wants a peek at some of the stuff I use to make 
DEHs (like a hacked Doom EXE that has all the frame code at -2
so it'll never "shorthand" on me), e-mail me at 
i_am_the_archon@hotmail.com. Use a descriptive subject line: 
"Hi!"-subject mails often get ignored as spam. The word 
"Fusion" will get my attention.


Anyway, here's the list of things, each prefixed with a -->.

--> More items. While DeHackEd ends at #137, Boom, MBF
and Fusion all added more. Here's a quick list:

138 - Boom wind pushy thing       #5001
139 - Boom wind pully thing       #5002
140 - MBF Dog                     #888
141 - MBF beta plasma 1           #xxx (Projectiles have no number
142 - MBF beta plasma 2           #xxx  - can't be placed on map.)
143 - MBF beta Evil Sceptre       #2016
144 - MBF beta Unholy Bible       #2017
145 - Fusion dead Revenant        #10101
146 - Fusion dead Spectre         #10102
147 - Fusion dead Mancubus        #10103

162 - Fusion beta plasma1 autosh. #10137 (Untested.)
163 - Fusion beta plasma2 autosh. #10138 (Untested.)


--> Frames up the wazoo. Doom stops in the 900s. Boom and MBF
add some more, so to be safe I started my own work on 1301. 
I'm up to 1771 now and still haven't hit the end.

All these are, as best I can tell, set completely to nulls. 


--> Codepointers! Codepointers! Codepointers! 

So, how do you use these pointers? Just like the Boom and MBF 
codepointers, on which there's already documentation. For instance:

- Start cybbfg.bex - Delete this line! - 
[CODEPTR]
Frame 685 = EnemyFireBFG
Frame 687 = EnemyFireBFG
Frame 689 = EnemyFireBFG
- End cybbfg.bex - Delete this line! - 

The Cyberdemon is now a bit tougher. He's packing a BFG!

When I speak of "Unknown 1" or "Misc1", I mean the same thing - the frame 
references id only used as what seems to be a temp file for weapon pointers.
(Therefore, they can't be used on weapon-frame codepointers, like the shotgun
animations. On the other hand, they DO work on weapon effects, like a BFG ball.)
To use them, add something like this to a DEH file (it'll possibly be 
redeleted by DeHackEd if ever reopened and saved in there, though!)

- Start cybplas.bex - Delete this line! - 
Frame 685
Unknown 1 = 35
Unknown 2 = 0

Frame 687
Unknown 1 = 141

Frame 689
Unknown 1 = 142

[CODEPTR]
Frame 685 = ProjectileFire
Frame 687 = ProjectileFire
Frame 689 = ProjectileFire
- End cybplas.bex - Delete this line! - 

Now he's a bit weaker - he fires 3 flavors of plasma. (Note: Unknown 2 
is only used by a few pointers. Not this one. It's assumed to be 0.
Therefore, its use with frame 685 is pointless - just there to show
syntax. Also note that ProjectileFire is the general case for EnemyFire
pointers. In other words, now you could make extra projectiles!
Added to the randomjump MBF pointer, you could have a monster who fires
a mix of slow, normal, and fast rockets.)

SHOOTERS: 

ShooterBetaPlasma2     These pointers make something shoot a projectile forward
ShooterBetaPlasma1     without aiming it. This allows projectiles to have 
ShooterBFG             secondary blasts, randomly-aiming gun turrets, beams that
ShooterRocket          need to be jumped over, and other good stuff.
ShooterPlasma          (Remember the Mauler in Strife? Heh heh heh.:)
ShooterDoubleShotgun
ShooterShotgun
ShooterPistol


MOVERS:

MoveDown 	       These four codepointers allow something to move up, down,
MoveUp    	       forward, and backward. Not meant for walking, since the
MoveBackward	       motion is a bit too smooth. Works well on projectiles, or
MoveForward 	       floating monsters. (Might be able to make a simple patrol 
     	               monster that moves in a circle, along with the MBF Turn
                       pointer. See also barrel.deh.)


PLAYER FIRED WEAPONS:

FireRevenant           Player Weapon codepointer: fires revenant rocket that 
                       doesn't home in.

FireImp                Player Weapon codepointer: fires imp fireball.
FireCaco               
FireArachnotron        (Guess.:)
FireBaron
FireMancubus           (Not angled - straight ahead.)

FireBetaPlasma2        Lets player fire one Beta Plasma gun shot. (Red?)
FireBetaPlasma1        Lets player fire one Beta Plasma gun shot. (Green?)


ENEMY-FIRED WEAPONS:

EnemyFireRocket        IIRC basically a copy of the Cyberdemon's attack 
                       codepointer. Allows enemy to fire a player-ish rocket.
EnemyFireBetaPlasma2   Allows enemy to fire one of the beta-release plasma
                       balls.
EnemyFireBetaPlasma1   See above.
EnemyFirePlasma        Enemy. Fire. Blue. Plasma.:)
EnemyFireBFG           It hurts.:)


FLAG-TOGGLERS (Most of these are untested!):

MFC_NobloodOff         Makes a monster bleed instead of puffing when shot.
MFC_NobloodOn          Makes a monster puff instead of bleeding when shot.
MFC_Noblood            Toggles bleeding and puffing. 
MFC_TranslucentOff     Makes translucent monster solid. 
MFC_TranslucentOn      Makes solid monster translucent.
MFC_Translucent        Toggles transluency.
MFC_FriendOff          \
MFC_FriendOn            By now you get the picture. Friendly monster flag.
MFC_Friend             /
MFC_TouchyOff          \
MFC_TouchyOn            Touchy (die when hit by any object) flag.
MFC_Touchy             /
MFC_FloatOff           \
MFC_FloatOn             Floating ability. (Untested!)
MFC_Float              /
MFC_ShadowOff          \
MFC_ShadowOn            Spectre "shadow" effect.
MFC_Shadow             /
MFC_BouncesOff         \Turns off bouncing. No BouncesOn, it 
MFC_Bounces            /seems. Use BouncesOff followed by Bounces.


MISC VIOLENCE:

Massacre              Effectively mimics KILLEM cheat, without the onscreen
                      message. Think D'Sparil's death in Heretic.
DetonateMisc          Like Detonate, but uses Unknown 1 for the radius damage.
                      (Detonate is an MBF codepointer - pick your own radius 
                      damage. Uses the missile damage thing-based setting
                      for its blast radius, instead of Unknown 1.)
ProjectileFire        Shoot thing number Unknown 1 like a fireball.
SplitAttack           For when you want to mimic an Imp or something like that
                      who can switch between claw and fireball without going 
                      through its animation frames again. Put this at the end
                      of the attack animation, on a 0-duration frame, pointing
                      at the attack frames.
                      Unknown 1 = close attack, Unknown 2 = far.  
DistanceDamage        Sort of a scratch attack that works at any range.


UNKNOWN: 

Burn                  Uhhhhh.... I don't know.
SkillJump             Doesn't work, thanks to my crap coding. I forgot a break; 
                      or something. Need coder help here!
ProjectileFire2       I forget.:) I think it was beta code that never got used.
                      It might be an attempt at generalizing Shooter above.
